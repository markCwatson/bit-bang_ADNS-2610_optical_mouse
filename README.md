# Bit-Bang the ADNS-2610 Optical Mouse Sensor

I recently found this old program on one of my drives. This was part of my first paid programming jobs while I was an undergrad at Dalhousie Univeristy in 2014. A prof asked me to hack the ADNS-2610 optical mouse sensor. I used two GPIO pins on a PIC microcontroller to match the timing diagram of the clock and data lines of the sensor. I found using the I2C peripheral didn't quite work so had to go the route of simulating each bit (i.e. bit-banging). The code is not good by any means, and I didn't bother trying to clean it up at all before uploading to GitHub, but it was a meaningful experience for me, and it may be useful for someone some day. See video link for a demonstration of the complete system.

This video shows a hacked ADNS-2610 from a Logitech optical mouse being used to watch the surface of a rotating cylinder. The cylinder is being rotated to mimic a cardiovascular flow profile. The above video shows two 8-bit PIC 16F887 microcontrollers being used to read from the ADNS-2610, as well as a Model ZSD Rotary Encoder (as a technique for verification). A stepper motor can be seen rotating a small plastic cylinder, and the stepper motor was controlled using an Arduino. The Graphical User Interface was built in MATLAB. The mounting brackets for the motor and encoder, as well as the cylinder itself, was modeled in SOLIDWORKS and printed using a 3D printer available to students and located in the Engineering Department at Dalhousie University. Although the ADNS-2610 data sheet shows a serial communication protocol similar to I2C, the sensor had to be bit-banged using custom software.
